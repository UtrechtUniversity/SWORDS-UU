T1  - Visualising changes in the construction of meaning with Word Vector Space
AU  - Viola, Lorella

PY  - 2020/11/9
Y1  - 2020/11/9
N2  - Natural language processing (NLP) techniques concerned with language and meaning (e.g., neural word embeddings) are mostly based on distributional semantics theory (Harris 1954; Firth 1957) and typically focus on mapping different senses expressed by single words. In recent years, although there has been an upsurge in such NLP studies, the investigation of language and meaning continues to stay for the majority on word level while its relation with discourse remains largely neglected. In this project, we propose an experimental method that aims to overcome such limitation. Specifically, we explore the value of merging neural word embeddings with the discourse-historical approach (DHA) (Reisigl and Wodak 2001) to investigate the historical changes in the semantic space of public discourse of migration in the United Kingdom. As data-set, we use the Times Digital Archive (TDA) from 1900 to 2000. For the computational part, we use publicly available TDA word2vec models (Kenter et al. 2015; Martinez-Ortiz et al. 2016); these models have been trained according to sliding time windows with the specific intention to map conceptual change. We then use DHA to triangulate the results generated by the word vector models with social and historical data to identify plausible explanations for the changes in the public debate. By bringing the focus of the analysis to the level of discourse, with this method, we aim to go beyond mapping different senses expressed by single words and to add the currently missing sociohistorical and sociolinguistic depth to the computational results. This repository shows the visualisation of the word2vec results. Please refer to Viola and Verheul (2020) for the discussion of the socio-historical triangulation.

T2  - 1.1.0
AU  - van Buuren, S.
PY  - 2020/11/2

N2  - The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a linear mixed model using a second-order linear B-spline. The main use of the model is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages. All fitting can done in the Z-score scale, so non-linearity and irregular data can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting a broken stick model to data, for predicting broken stick curves in new data, and for plotting the broken stick estimates. For additional documentation on background, methodology and applications of the broken stick model see .

AU  - Aarts, E.
PY  - 2019/10/30
Y1  - 2019/10/30
N2  - An implementation of the multilevel (also known as mixed or random effects) hidden Markov model using Bayesian estimation in R. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the well-known hidden Markov model, for the latter see Rabiner (1989) . The multilevel HMM is tailored to accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of multiple individuals simultaneously, see e.g., de Haan-Rietdijk et al. . Using a multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in the model parameters (transition probability matrix and conditional distribution), while estimating one overall HMM. The model can be fitted on multivariate data with a categorical distribution, and include individual level covariates (allowing for e.g., group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The package also includes various visualization options, a function to simulate data, and a function to obtain the most likely hidden state sequence for each individual using the Viterbi algorithm.

T2  - A Python science library for storing and sharing numeric data arrays in a way that is open, simple, and self-explanatory
AU  - Beckers, G.J.L.

Y1  - 2018
N2  - Darr is a Python science library for efficient read/write/append access to disk-persistent numeric data arrays. There are other Python libraries for this, but Darr also ensures tool-independent and long-term accessibility of your data. It saves and automatically updates a human-readable explanation of how your binary data is stored, together with code for reading the specific data in a variety of current scientific data tools such as Python, R, Julia, IDL, Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica (see example arrays).In essence, Darr enables you to work with potentially very large data arrays in a Python/NumPy environment, and share this data as is with others who do not use Darr, or even Python, without exporting anything. It is also an easy way to make sure you can read your own data in the future when you may use different tools.Darr currently supports numerical N-dimensional arrays, and experimentally supports numerical ragged arrays, i.e. a series of arrays in which one dimension varies in length.See this tutorial for a brief introduction, or the documentation for more info.Darr is currently pre-1.0, still undergoing significant development. It is open source and freely available under the New BSD License terms.

N2  - The UU Crowd Simulation Framework creates high-quality navigation meshes and uses them for path planning and crowd simulation in big dynamic environments.A huge challenge is to simulate tens of thousands of characters in real-time where they pro-actively and realistically avoid collisions with each other and with obstacles present in their environment. This environment contains semantic information (e.g. roads and bicycle lanes, dangerous and pleasant areas), is three-dimensional (e.g. contains bridges where people can walk over and under as well) and can dynamically change (e.g. a bridge partially collapses). We currently study how to create a generic framework centered around a navigation mesh, for such environments and how it can be updated dynamically and efficiently. Next, we study how (groups of) people move and avoid collisions in such environments, based on character profiles and semantics. We run our simulations in realistic environments (e.g. soccer stadiums or train stations) and game levels to study the effectiveness of our methods. We have created a software package that integrates this research.

T1  - TDS Curator: Typological Database System
AU  - Dimitriadis, A.
AU  - Windhouwer, M. A.
PY  - 2012
Y1  - 2012
N2  - The Typological Database System (TDS) is a web-based service that provides integrated access to a collection of independently created typological databases. It was developed with support from NWO grant 380-30-004 / INV-03-12 and from participating universities, and provides continued access and extended documentation for its component databases through a uniform interface. 

TDS Curator has turned the TDS into a sustainable service that conforms to CLARIN infrastructural requirements. We have adapted the TDS approach to the archiving domain, by formalizing the Integrated Data and Documentation Format (IDDF), which provides a rich XML-based container for the collected semi-structured data and their documentation; and coupling this with a service-based access point and a “generic” user interface, that is to say, a software suite that is independent of the particular data collections but provides a high level of functionality for navigating the IDDF structure and metadata. 

The TDS Curator server is hosted by DANS. The data resources of the TDS are made available through the User Interface, and separately as archived resources on the DANS archiving system, EASY.

T1  - XLD: A framework for Cross-linguistic Survey Databases
AU  - Dimitriadis, A.
PY  - 2012
Y1  - 2012
N2  - The system is designed to house information about languages in a flexible and highly configurable fashion. It is based on a framework that is specially tailored to cross-linguistic surveys, but allows a wide range of cross-linguistic survey projects to be easily supported. Copies are actively used by a half-dozen different projects in Utrecht, Leiden, Jena (Germany), Rutgers (US) and elsewhere.

The new version is more flexible, robust, and better suited to use by multiple project members and outside consultants.

N2  - Mondriaan is a sequential program written in C that can be used to partition a rectangular sparse matrix, an input vector, and an output vector for parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication. The program is based on a recursive bipartitioning algorithm that cuts the matrix horizontally and vertically, in a manner resembling some of the famous Mondriaan paintings. The algorithm is multilevel, hypergraph-based, and two-dimensional. It reduces the amount of communication and it spreads both computation and communication evenly over the processors. The program can partition hypergraphs with integer vertex weights and uniform hyperedge costs, but it is primarily intended as a matrix partioner.",

N2  - PreScriptum is een telematische cursus over de probleemstelling van een onderzoek die geheel on-line gevolgd kan worden. In de cursus, die ontwikkeld is in het programma WebCT, wordt gewerkt met 'het structuurmodel van de probleemstelling' van Heinze Oost (1999). 
De cursus bestaat uit vijf modulen. Elke module behandelt een van de vijf criteria van het structuurmodel. Uitgelegd wordt wat het criterium inhoudt, waarom het belangrijk is om aan het criterium te voldoen en hoe de probleemstelling uitgewerkt moet worden om aan het criterium te voldoen. De modules bevatten: een zelftest, een of meerdere oefeningen, referenties en een vraagbaak. Elke module wordt afgesloten met een opdracht. In de opdrachten moet de cursist de cursusinhoud toepassen op zijn/haar eigen onderzoek. Iedere cursist krijgt op elke opdracht individueel, schriftelijk feedback van de docent. Ook deze communicatie vindt in WebCT plaats.
De volgorde waarin modules bestudeerd kunnen worden, ligt niet vast; de cursus is non-lineair opgezet. Iedere cursist kan zijn/haar eigen route door de cursus bepalen. Wel wordt verwacht dat een cursist elke week een module bestudeert en een opdracht maakt.
